`poweRof10` is a small package that scrapes data from athletics rankings website www.powerof10.info. I'm a big athletics fan and created `poweRof10` for a bit of fun to analyse my own performances, but thought it might be worth sharing here. The package is still a little rough around the edges, but the basic functionality should work well enough!

## Basic usage

You can get the rankings for a specific event/year/gender/agegroup using the `get_event` function:

```{r}
get_event(event = "100", agegroup = "ALL", gender = "M", year = 2016, top_n = 10) %>% 
  select(rank, perf, name, venue)
```

Alternatively, you can search for an individual athlete and get their performance history:

```{r}
get_athlete(fn = "Harry", sn = "Fisher", club = "Cardiff/Cardiff Met Uni") %>% 
  select(event, perf, pos, venue, date) %>% 
  head(10)
```

## Installation

Install from github with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_git("hfshr/poweRof10")
```

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the team that keep www.powerof10.info up and running, it's an invaluable resource for many!
